# Jeff Doan; a bit about me.

A lover of __garage rock and minivans__; a __product designer__ and front-end tinkerer; a [husband and a rad dad with 15% more mohawk](http://instagram.com/p/s6ARy0lfay/). I also love Tolkein and Discworld; [wiener dogs](http://instagram.com/p/CxfHT/); and my collection of colorful pants.

__To me, product design is not about making beautiful things.__ Effective product design is about creating something that you truly believe in; something human beings will, and want to, use; and making it better and better everyday.

The word beautiful permeates the digital product world unfortunately; and __it does nothing to help me, nor anyone else, derive any significant value about said product__.

Also, I live in Arlington, VA with my South African wife, rambunctious daughter, and wiener dog named Bean. Email me @ the.jeffdoan@gmail.com or give me a shout @ 703-867-5220.
