I make things for the mobile web, and I love HTML email. I'm also a lover of garage rock, vinyls, and minivans; a product designer and front-end tinkerer; a husband and dad. I also love Tolkein and Discworld, Led Zeppelin, my collection of colorful pants, and I live in LA. I love making products that help people do things they easily cannot do otherwise.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To me, product design is about creating something of value; something actual people will want to use. It's the process of making it better and better everyday. It's learning what your users do, where they struggle, why they struggle, and how to alleviate those struggles, where possible.

Product design is almost never about making beautiful things. The word beautiful permeates the digital product world far too often; and it does nothing to help anyone derive significant value about a product.

Solving user problems, with business goals in mind, is my bag. Below are some of my skills & resume:

* UX design: research, user testing, sketching & wireframing
* UI design: Sketch/Photoshop, hand-coded prototyping
* Front-end: HTML, CSS & JavaScript (some React)
* Back-end: PHP, some Ruby/Rails
* HTML email: design, build & testing
* git & markdown
* Jekyll & Wordpress
* SaaS marketing & design
* Being a music snob & hating on Facebook
