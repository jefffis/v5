# A bit about me
I make things for the mobile web, and I love HTML email. I’m a Los Angeles-based nerd, product designer, front-end tinkerer, husband and father. Whenever I can, I try to make products that help people do things they cannot easily do otherwise. I have 12+ years of UX/UI design, front-end (HTML, CSS & JavaScript) experience, and am dangerous enough when it comes to Ruby/Rails and PHP.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

About creating something of value; something actual people will want to use. It’s the process of making the product better and better everyday. It’s learning what your users are doing, where they
struggle, why they are struggling, and how to alleviate those struggles, where possible. It’s also learning how they use your product: on Windows, mobile, low-bandwidth access, etc., and then
designing for these scenarios.

Product design is almost never about making beautiful things. The word beautiful permeates the digital product world far too often; and it does nothing to help anyone derive significant value about
a product. Let’s rather make something with meaning than with beauty.

Can I help you build better products? Get in touch, the.jeffdoan@gmail.com, if so.
