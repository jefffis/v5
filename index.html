          <h1>Product designer &amp; maker of web stuff.</h1>
          <p>
            I&rsquo;m a Denver-based <strong>nerd, product designer, amateur developer</strong>,  bad drummer, and father. I&rsquo;m also a lover of garage rock, Led Zeppelin vinyls, minivans, Tolkien &amp; Discworld, and my collection of colorful pants. I have 15+ years of UX/UI design, front-end (HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript) experience, and am dangerous enough when it comes to Ruby/Rails and PHP.
          </p>
          <p>
            I make products that help people do things they cannot easily do otherwise <em>(like <a href="#myperfectjob">MyPerfectJob</a>, <a href="#systemic">Systemic</a>, <a href="#findnewsletters">Find Your Newsletter</a>, <a href="#saas-weekly">SaaS Weekly</a>, <a href="#imgRszr">imgRszr</a>, or <a href="#betalist">Betalist</a>)</em>. I love product design because it lets me dive into user research, interaction design, visual design, and product management.
          </p>
          <p class="mantra">
            To me, product design is about creating something of value; something actual people will want to use. It&rsquo;s the process of making the product better and better everyday. It&rsquo;s learning what your users are doing, where they are struggling, why they are struggling, and how to alleviate those struggles, where possible. It&rsquo;s also learning how they use your product: on Windows, mobile, low-bandwidth access, etc., and then designing for these scenarios.
          </p>
          <p class="mantra">
            Product design is almost never about making beautiful things. The word beautiful permeates the digital product world far too often; and it does nothing to help anyone derive significant value about a product. Let&rsquo;s rather make something with meaning than with beauty.

        <p>In my humble opinion, the most important part of a website is the actual words used on a given page (especially the headline). So I interviewed 16 non-customers to understand their jobs, pains, and tools. I then summarized this into themes and 6 variants of value propositions, and tested this further (using message testing).</p>

          <p>
            <strong>The Problem</strong>
            <br />
            Overdue tasks are a huge point of pain for users of task systems everywhere. People love starting new task systems (Things, Asana, whatever), but once you start collecting old/overdue tasks people start throwing away/ignoring/starting over.<!--  <strong>Overdue tasks are actually two things:</strong> -->
          </p>
          <!-- <p>
            - They are the most important tasks for some people. They represent things that are critically late. And need to be done ASAP.
            <br>
            - Or they weren&rsquo;t done for a reason. Have accumulated and need to be rescheduled, thrown out, or ignored.
          </p> -->
          <p>
            <strong>My Solution</strong>
          <br />
            <em>Note: this was a design exercise, I put my best effort forth with all that I knew at the time.</em> That said, at a high-level, for Overdue tasks: break out the list into groupings based on their Category. Plus, add in bulk editing of tasks, giving the user a quick way to dismiss loads of tasks that are not critical, or might be long gone. You can also bulk update (i.e. adjust due dates, assingees, etc.) loads of tasks at the same time. Any time you add bulk editing for actions, you also need to add in undo support for these as well. Supporting mistakes in UI is critical to reducing anxiety around updating tasks. Along with these new additions to the overall system, I wanted to add in a Deleted view to allow for more power user support.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also introduced a new concept of Ongoing tasks. This type of task can cover a lot things: at it&rsquo;s most basic it&rsquo;s for tasks that are important for the user to eventually get done, but not priority enough to assign a due-date to it <em>(or after it&rsquo;s been languishing as Overdue)</em>. Or, they are tasks the re-occur on some basis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, I also wanted to introduce the concept of Task Capacity. This concept would help to alert the logged-in user, as well as their superiors, about their actual workload based on what is assigned to them. Having a measurable way to see their capacity feels like it could be really effective in reducing burnout or frustration, as well as for bubbling up workloads.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was offered the job @ Highrise, but I decided to stay local. Thus, my efforts were very well received by the team. 😃
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What I did</strong>
            <br />
            I researched, iterated, designed and built the front-end for this prototype.

          <p>
            <strong>The Problem</strong>
            <br />
            Getting help on a website can be overwhelming, and often is an afterthought from a design standpoint. At Tradesy, we knew that our current solution (like so many others) was lacking, as well as it was actually creating a bottle neck for our Member Care Team.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Our Solution</strong>
            <br />
            We focussed on designing &amp; building a solution that freed up our Member Care agents to help out our members who really had large issues, and to allow our members with small issues to get the help they needed by themselves, and thus get back to more important things in their lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using Zendesk&rsquo;s API, we pulled all the content onto our site to create a seamless experience for our members on tradesy.com. If a member is logged in, we can better tailor the types of suggested articles to help them, as well as if they need to contact us, we automatically pass over all the necessary data to our Member Care team without the member needing to do or provide anything else.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also designed and built a new &ldquo;short answer&rdquo; concept that we are truly proud of. A member who has an issue drills down from the new Help homepage into a chosen category, and gets to a list of questions relating to their issue. Inside each question, is a summary of the question (i.e. the short answer), that should be salient enough to answer 99% of our users issues. If it&rsquo;s not, then they can read the full article, or they can then contact us.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What I did</strong>
            <br />
            I designed and built the front-end, and integrated the API code necessary for this.

          </div>
          <p>
            <strong>The Problem</strong>
            <br />
          Filtering to the right set of products on an eCommerce site is so paramount to a shoppers success, and we&rsquo;ve known for a while our current filters don&rsquo;t cut it. There is no way to bulk apply filters: each filter you applied reloads the page. This leads to mass user frustration, and less satisfaction with the results of using our filters. The current filters also lack large, easy tap targets, and suffer from poor UX in general (i.e. using them is confusing and unpredictable).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Our Solution</strong>
            <br />
          We set out to build more intuitive, and more predictable filters to help our members find what they wanted to. The result (not in production yet, but in user-testing) has proven to do just what we wanted it to&mdash;it&rsquo;s allowed our users to, in a stable manner, filter down to the right set of items quicker and easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along with making the filtering process itself more intuitive, we also looked at the types of filters we have, their existing usage data (to help inform ordering), and how we could improve upon the types of filters available for a given result set.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What I did</strong>
            <br />
            I designed and built the prototype, and ran user-testing sessions.

            <br />
            Start-ups struggle to generate extra revene outside of their original business models. For large marketplaces, it&rsquo;s common to eventually introduce ways for sellers willing to spend a bit more, to get more out of the marketplace. We felt that in 2016, given our current size, scale and traffic of daily sellers, it was the rigth time for us to do this with Promoted Listings.
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>Our Solution</strong>
            <br />
            Still in development, we&rsquo;ve put a lot of thought and effort into designing an advertising system that would help all our sellers succeed. On Tradesy, we have all types of sellers: pro-sellers, power sellers, and casual sellers. We wanted to build something that all our sellers, if they chose to participate in, could find success with.

          <p>
            <strong>What I did</strong>
            <br />
            An ongoing effort that I researched and worked on initial designs / front-end builds for.

          <p class="lg">Transactional Email Standards</p>
          <p>
            <strong>The Problem</strong>
            <br />
            Email, even in 2016, is still so important to a business. Transactional emails are often overlooked, or are considered outside the normal scope of design standards. From inconsistent type treatments, random item cards, to different footers; we needed a holistic approach to bring our email branding full circle.
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>Our Solution</strong>
            <br />
            We started by looking at our two main member flows: buying an item and selling an item. From this we were able to identify all the types of modules that could be used in a transactional. We chose to use system fonts so that we could allow the operating system to best optimize these (even in 2016 custom fonts in emails are not very well supported). We then moved all content to a single column format, to allow for easiest readability and maintenance of the templates.
          </p>
          <p>
            These emails work and look great in all clients: Outlook, Gmail (yes, even Gmail for mobile), and everywhere in-between.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What I did</strong>
            <br />
            An ongoing effort that I researched and worked on initial designs / front-end builds for. I also built and tested the template for proper support in all major email clients.

Our current website was built like many other websites: responsive to work across all browser widths. This also meant that, like many other sites, we had a 🍔 menu. There have been many studies done on whether the hamburger menu works or not, but internally, we knew the hamburger was a bad solution to a complicated problem.

          <h3>Mused on February 16, 2015</h3>
          <p>We designers are trying our damndest to kill the web. And we&#39;ve been doing it since web design became a thing. Think about this: the responsive web is <strong>something we had to make because we broke it</strong>. The web, in its very own nature is responsive.</p>

          <p>Developers everywhere fear older versions of IE, its's a fact, and it's a fact for good reason. Supporting IE 8, 7 and possibly even 6 makes building the web unfun. But, for some business verticals and clients, it's a necessity, as for some of them, their users still traverse the web with these older, archaic browsers. And, there is not much we can do about this, outside of a few hacky-type things.</p>

It takes practice after you build a solid foundation of understanding design principles.

          <p>I recently updated my site to use Jekyll, markdown, and Unicode icons. There are, of course, still some images, but only as necessary. Portfolio samples and 4 header images to give the site some character. However, I decided to dump a lot of tiny details in buttons and whatnot in favor of just focussing on content, and speed. The images I do use are pretty well optimized, but being that they are portfolio pieces, there's only so small I was willing to go.</p>
