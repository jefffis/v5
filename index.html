				<p><strong>Used on over 4.6 million visits</strong> since we released in August 2015. I killed the off-canvas menu, and simplified the navigation for our mobile users. The result: <strong>increased engagement, but more importantly, conversions</strong>.</p>
				<p>I also built a <strong>custom registration and login screen to do away with modal windows</strong>. These are much more stable and predictable; and lead to better form completion. <strong>Note:</strong> for the most part, this entaled only chrome edits.

				<h3>Mused on <strong>October 15, 2015</strong></h3>
				<p>
					Continuing in our updates to mobile web traffic for Tradesy.com, along with our navigation updates, we killed modals* for mobile visitors. Again, as many web sites often do, we used (& still do) modals a lot. Like A LOT. But for our mobile web visitors, it was just a very awkward, unpleasant experience.

				<h3>Mused on <strong>October 15, 2015</strong></h3>
				<p>
					Everyone knows that mobile traffic has surpassed desktop traffic; especially when it comes to eCommerce. In 2015, Tradesy.com‚Äôs traffic experienced the same pivotal moment in April. Our current website was built like many other websites: responsive to work across all browser widths. This also meant that, like many other sites, we had a üçî menu. There have been many studies done on whether the hamburger menu works or not, but internally, we knew the hamburger was a bad solution to a complicated problem.

				<p>The title kinda says it all: Don&#39;t lose focus. Either of what you want your users to do on your site, but more specifically, don&#39;t lose the oft forgotten pseudo styling for interactions. CSS resets are great, but often times you&#39;ll reset default browser styling that, unless properly redefined, is critical to helping your users when interacting with any type of website.</p>

		      <h3>Mused on February 25, 2013</h3>
		      <p>While working on a recent project, I (re-)discovered the issue of client misunderstandings and perceptions of browsers and rendering. While a lot of people have talked about this, and tweeted about it, and mentioned that this is part of what we do, it's not where it needs to be yet. I don't know what the actual solution is to bridging the gap, but I'll run through some scenarios and how I might handle them.</p>

		      <h3>Mused on February 20, 2013</h3>
		      <p>Everyone knows responsive web design (henceforth RWD). Well, people in the web industry, and those working closely with web folk; they pretty much all know what that term implies. And they all probably have their own opinions about whether it's good or bad, or at least going in the right direction. But what about responsive email design?</p>

		      <h3>Mused on February 19, 2013</h3>
		      <p>I recently updated my site to use Jekyll, markdown, and Unicode icons. There are, of course, still some images, but only as necessary. Portfolio samples and 4 header images to give the site some character. However, I decided to dump a lot of tiny details in buttons and whatnot in favor of just focussing on content, and speed. The images I do use are pretty well optimized, but being that they are portfolio pieces, there's only so small I was willing to go.</p>

		      <p>Email is not dead. Email is not wrong. Email is not broken. Is it awesome to use all the time? No, of course not. But, as a medium, it is fine that is suiting it's purpose fairly well.</p>

		      <p>This is something I don't do often enough for sure. Some of this is laziness, but some of it is just budget constraint. But this is one of the most important parts of creating success; whether you're building a new product or working on a client project.</p>
